# Functional Programming In Scala

Tracking my exercises from the excellent book "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chicano and RÃºnar Bjarnason.

This is probably the best book on functional programming with Scala.

The Exercises are structured in packages for each chapter of the book. I use IntelliJ, SBT and the Scala REPL.
