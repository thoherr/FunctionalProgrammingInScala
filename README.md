# Functional Programming In Scala

Tracking my exercises from the excellent book "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chicano and RÃºnar Bjarnason.

This is probably the best book on functional programming in Scala.

The official repository of hints and answers for the book exercises is located at https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala in GitHub.

## compiling and running with sbt

The Exercises are structured in packages for each chapter of the book.
I use IntelliJ, SBT and the Scala REPL. The .idea directory is excluded from the repo, you can easily use any IDE you like and import the sources.

With sbt, you may just use

    sbt compile

and

    sbt console
